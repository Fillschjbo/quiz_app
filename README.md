# Quiz Game

## Project Description
This is a console-based Trivia Quiz Game written in Python. The game loads questions from a data source (originally a JSON file, later migrated to MySQL), presents them to the user with multiple-choice options, tracks the score, and displays final results with statistics. The project demonstrates object-oriented design, file/database handling, error management, and team-based software development practices.
